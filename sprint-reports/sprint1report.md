Work Summary (Developer Facing) 

Provide a one paragraph synopsis of what your team accomplished this sprint. Don't repeat the "What's New" list of features. Instead, help the instructor understand how you went about the work described there, any barriers you overcame, and any significant learnings for your team. 

 During this sprint, our team focused on strengthening the internal structure of the app to support user authentication and profile management. We implemented full account creation and login functionality, ensuring that user information could be stored and retrieved securely in the future from the backend. We also experimented with using ChatGPT-5 to help provide alternate and expanded language. This will help provide more comprehensive experiences for users and create more accurate matches. On the backend, we utilized MongoDB in a Dockized environment to handle our data storage, which will allow for a more reliable and isolated development setup.  

Unfinished Work 

If applicable, explain the work you did not finish in this sprint. For issues/user stories in the current sprint that have not been closed, (a) any progress toward completion of the issues has been clearly tracked (by checking the checkboxes of acceptance criteria), (b) a comment has been added to the issue to explain why the issue could not be completed (e.g., "we ran out of time" or "we did not anticipate it would be so much work"), and (c) the issue is added to a subsequent sprint, so that it can be addressed later. 

We were unable to complete the process to add in an email only login option as we were still in process of connecting are backend and frontend options. As we will be working on this process in subsequent sprints it will be addressed fully then.
